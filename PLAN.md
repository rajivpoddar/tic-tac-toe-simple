# Project Plan for Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Vision
Create an engaging and interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game that allows two players to compete against each other. The game will be simple yet fun, with a clean and modern user interface that resembles the provided UI mockup.

## Scope
The game will feature a 3x3 grid where players can take turns to place their 'X' or 'O'. It will track scores, indicate the current player's turn, allow undoing moves, reset the board, and automatically detect wins or ties.

## Deliverables
1. A game board displayed on the screen.
2. Interactive grid cells where players can place their marks.
3. Turn-taking functionality for two players.
4. Score tracking for each player.
5. An indicator for the current player's turn.
6. A 'Previous Step' button to undo the last move.
7. A 'Reset Board' button to clear the game for a new round.
8. Automatic detection of wins or ties.
9. Automatic score update when a player wins.
10. Prevention of further moves after a win or tie.

## Development Phases
1. Initialize the React application.
2. Plan the project scope, vision, and deliverables.
3. Design the application architecture and component structure.
4. Implement the game logic using TDD.
5. Style the application to match the UI mockup.
6. Integrate all components and ensure functionality.
7. Translate user stories into test cases and ensure all tests pass.
8. Document the project review in LESSONS.md.
